Notes:
Components: 
Reuseable piece of code that can be used to build elements on the page
Allows us to break down complex UIs, which makes them easier to maintain and scale
Components can get props passed in and can hold their own state
State:
Represents the data that a component manages internally
Could be form input data, fetched data, UI-related data like if a modal is openclose. Data that is expected to change
There is also global state, which relates to the app as a whole and not a single component
Hooks
Allow us to use state and other React features within functional components (useState, useEffect, useRef, etc)
JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)
HTML-like syntax within JavaScript (components)
SPA (Single Page App)
Loads a single HTML file and JavaScript loads the entire UI including routes
SSR (Server-Side Rendered)
Server sends fully rendered page to client. you can fetch data and load it as well
SSG (Static Site Generation)
React generates static HTML files at build time. These are very fast
