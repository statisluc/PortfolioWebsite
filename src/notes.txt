ADD footer that stays at the bottom of the page that contains linkedin and github link (for mobile, have these buttons 
in the hamburger menu) 
--or you can just have these buttons on the home page, that might actually look a good bit cleaner

for the projects, include super black jack, the terminal wheel of fortune game from the laptop, and you can 
definitely make a quick gas price calculator app with instructions (then within the page/app say an updated more improved version
with google maps api will be released soon)
